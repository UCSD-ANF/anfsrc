This file describes how to setup "SRB_synch_orbregistries". For how to run this program, please
refer to the man page/file.

Note: This setup guide assumes you know the basics of SRB, especially Scommands, such 
      as making a directory (Smkdir) and registering a SRB object (Sregister). For more 
      information on SRB, please go to http://www.npaci.edu/DICE/SRB/

Step:

1. Check if you have everything. You need:
       (a) A SRB server (ver. SRB3.1Roadnet)
       (b) A SRB client pakage, which exists on the same machine with this program,
           but not necessarily the same machine with the server. 
       (c) Registry database(s) that store orb information. 

2. If does not exist, create a direcotry that will contain all registry 
   databases, as SRB objects. For example, 
   'Smkdir "Datascope Registries"' will make the directory.
   Then find out the absolute path of this directory. and replace the 
   value for SRB_COLLECTION_REGISTRIES in file "SRB_synch_orbregistries.h".

3. If does not exist, registerd the registry databases as SRB objects under the 
   directory you just created. For example,
   Sregister -p -R "mercali-datascope-1" -D "datascope data" "/home/rt/rtsystems/status/db/ven_orbregistry<DSPRESENTATION>db2html</DSPRESENTATION>?SHADOW" "ven_orbregistry"   

4. If does not exist, create a direcotry that will contain all registered ORBs 
   as SRB objects. For example, 
   'Smkdir "Registered ORBs"' will make the directory.
	 Then find out the absolute path of this directory. and replace the 
   value for SRB_COLLECTION_REGISTERED_ORBS in file "SRB_synch_orbregistries.h".

5. Make sure all pathes in Makefile are correct.

6. type "Make" to build the program.

 * initial checking for SRB_synch_orbregistries.
 *
 * This
 * utility reads in orb information from Datascope (Antelope) registry
 * databases, which are pre-registered as SRB objects, and attempt to
 * build/synchronize a collection of all ORB data sources stored across all
 * databases. Each Orb source is registered as a SRB object, and can be
 * queried though SRB. SRB_synch_orbregistries also insert metadata for each SRB-ORB. It is very
 * useful if you want to query the ORBs based on this metadata.
 *
 * Please read file "SETUP" to learn how to configure this program, and read the man file SRB_synch_orbregistries.1 to learn how to run the program.
