.TH SRB_SYNCH_ORBREGISTRIES 1 2005/01/05 "VORB" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
SRB_synch_orbregistries \- synchronize/register ORB resources stored in database and 
ORB resources registered as SRB objects. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B SRB_synch_orbregistries
[\-hr] [\-t num_testcase] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
There are more than 10 thousand ORB data sources connecting to ROADNet. 
It is sensible to register them into SRB (Storage Resource Broker), thus 
they can be indexed, managed and accessed with easy from anywhere.  This 
utility reads in orb information from Datascope (Antelope) registry 
databases, which are pre-registered as SRB objects, and attempt to 
build/synchronize a collection of all ORB data sources stored across all 
databases. Each Orb source is registered as a SRB object, and can be 
queried though SRB. 
.PP
SRB_synch_orbregistries also insert metadata for each SRB-ORB. It is very 
useful if you want to query the ORBs based on this metadata.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-h
Display a short help text
.TP
\-r
Rebuild the ORB collection. Please note that rebuilding, like first time 
building, could be very time consuming, due to the massive number of ORBs.
This option is recommened only if you want a fresh start. 
.TP
\-t
Test mode. The argument is a integer. It exam up to this number of ORBs, 
per network. This option is highly recommened when you want to test this 
program.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
A normal synch process or first time build:
.B SRB_synch_orbregistries
.PP
.TP
Synch up to 8 ORBs per network:
.B SRB_synch_orbregistries
\-t 8
.PP
.TP
Synch up to 10 ORBs per network, with rebuild option:
.B SRB_synch_orbregistries
\-r -t 8
.PP
.SH EXIT STATUS
SRB_synch_orbregistries returns a zero exist status if it succeeds to synchronize. 
Non zero is returned in case of failure.
