.SH NAME
VG700CA \- gathers rotational info from the VG700CA gyro
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
VG700CA [-v] [-z] [-w] [-V] [-p serialport] [-d serialspeed] [-l logfile]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
VG700CA connects to a VG700CA gyro and does calculations on the results. It
is almost entirely a standalone application, ie, no ORB interaction. VG700CA
starts up and pings the gyro over the serial port. It then gathers model and
serial number information and enters the 5 minute warm up cycle, where it
waits for the gyro to come to operating temperature. If the device has already
warmed up then this can be skipped with the -w option. Then the device enters
the zero option where it zeros the individual sensors to get a more accurate
reading. This must happen before the gyro operates after a cold boot, but you
can skip it if you have run it since the last time the gyro powered
down. After that, it enters continous mode and starts grabbing data from the
gyro. In verbose mode (-v) it outputs stats throughout the measurement
period. Additionally, it will log these stats to a log file with the (-l)
option. When you have completed the measurement period, hit <ENTER> and the
program exits contious mode in the gyro and summarizes the results (on the
screen and in the log file).

The data output is in 3 sets: the rate of change, the cummulative change and
the linear orthogonal corrected change (the actual change). The summary
results are for linear orthogonal correct change, but the cummulative change
is available in the timeseries data provided in verbose mode and in the log file.
.SH OPTIONS
.nf
-V				print version and usage, then exit

-v				verbose mode

-z				skip zero mode (required after it is first
				powered up and after large movements or 
				temp changes) Takes 3 min.

-w				skip the warm up mode, a 5 min period where it
				simply waits for the gyro to stabilize in
				temperature. Only required if it has not been
				on for a while or the temp has changed
				drastically.

-l logfile		log results and stats to this file

-p serialport		serial port to listen to (/dev/ttyS3 default) 
				38.4 kbaud

-d serialspeed		speed to set serial port to (default = 38.4 kbps)
