.SH DESCRIPTION
orbnmea2db takes NMEA data from an orbserver and puts them in 
a database in nmea0.1 format.

If "after" is specified, the given string is interpreted as a 
time and used to select the earliest of the orb packets to be 
translated. If "until" is also specified, orbnmea2db will exit 
as soon as it gets a packet that is later than the specified end time. 
Both of these times may be strings interpretable by str2epoch(3).
