.SH NAME
submit2orb \- submits a raw orb packet contained in a file to the ORB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
submit2orb orbname datafile NET_STA timestamp
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
It is sometimes useful to submit a packet to the orb without adding any wrappers. This application simple loads a packet from a file and submits it to the ORB under the name NET_STA/EXP/ORACLEpf. This enables a command line script to submit orb packets. 

This application is used by perl_dbi_YYL.pl to insert orb packets into antelope. This is because perl_dbi_YYL.pl requires an ORACLE DBI library that does not seem to work with antelopes perl implementation. If that problem is solved then perl_dbi_YYL.pl could be rewritten to not use this.
.SH OPTIONS
.nf
all command line arguments are mandatory.
