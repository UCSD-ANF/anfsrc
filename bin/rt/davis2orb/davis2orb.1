.SH NAME
davis2orb - interface code for Davis weather stations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
davis2orb [-v] [-V] [-r repeat] [-p serialport] [-d serialspeed] [-s net_sta ] [-o $ORB]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
davis2orb samples weather data from Davis Vantage Pro data loggers. It first, connects to the davis and gets the loggers attention. After attention, it requests 1 sample. This is read from the logger and the checksum is verified. If the checksum fails, we try again, up to 25 times. In the end, we try our best to maintain the sample rate desired, if that is not possible we will usually print a warning message.
