.SH NAME
align-seismic \- A tool to align seismometers in an enclosure using a GPS and a Gyro
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
Using a Novatel Beeline GPS with two antennas on a 1 meter bar, we can gather
orientation and position information for a seismometer (BEELINE(1)). Then
using a VG700CA Gyro (CrossBow) we can translate that orientation to a
seismometer mounted inside of an enclosure (VG700CA(1)). This program ties the
two applications together to get a single command interface to accomplish both
tasks. To do this you will need a computer connect to both of these
instruments simulataneously. At one point you will need to disconnect the GPS
and move the computer with the Gyro until it is adjacent to the Seismometer.
.SH Alignment Process

1) the User connects the computer to the GPS and Gyro. the user also
   mounts the Gyro to the GPS mounting bracket.

2) the user powers up the GPS, Gyro and Computer.

3) the user starts align-seimic and follows the prompts

	a) the GPS is warmed up and once warm beeline(1) starts to record a 
	   3 minute history log and then spits out the last results read.

	b) the Gyro program is started. It takes some time to warm up and
	   then zero the internal bias. After which it begins a 5 second
	   count down and allows you to move into the enclosure. When you
	   have matched the gyro with the Seismometer, hit <ENTER> to record
	   the results and shut down the gyro.
