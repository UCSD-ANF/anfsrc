.TH SBE39ORB 1 "$Date: 2004/04/02 00:10:38 $"
.SH NAME
sbe39orb \- communicate with Seabird 39 water temp sensors
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
sbe39orb [-v] [-V] [-n portnumber] [-c net_sta] [-i interval] [-o $ORB] -a ipaddress 
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
sbe39orb connects to the ip address specified and querys the logger for its immediate water temperature reading. After which it generates an orb packet and goes to sleep until the next interval. The packets are encrypted in their native format, which can be decomposed using unstuffPkt() into waveform packets.

.nf
-v		verbose mode
-V		print version, usage and exit
