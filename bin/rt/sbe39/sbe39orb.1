.TH SBE39ORB 1 "$Date: 2007/02/24 01:14:53 $"
.SH NAME
sbe39orb \- communicate with Seabird 39 water temp sensors
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
sbe39orb [-v] [-V] [-n portnumber] [-c net_sta] [-i interval] [-o $ORB] -a ipaddress 
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION

sbe39orb connects to the ip address specified and queries the logger
for its immediate water temperature reading. After this, it generates
an orb packet and goes to sleep until the next interval. The packets
are encrypted in their native format, which can be decomposed using
unstuffPkt() into waveform packets.

.SH OPTIONS
.nf
-v		verbose mode
-V		print version, usage and exit
-a ipaddress	what IP address to use (don't use with option -p)

-n portnumber	what IP port to connect to (use only with option -a, 
		default 4000)

-c net_sta_chan	srcname to use for packaging data for this sensor. It is
		also used to lookup info in the config file.

-i interval	if you want to check the sensor for data periodically,
		specify it here (in seconds), otherwise sbe39orb will exit
		when it has downloaded the current sample.


-o $ORB		specify the orb to which data should be sent (default ":")
