.SH NAME
cbdeck2orb \- translate CSV values from a composite bridge deck system on a TCP port into MGENC packets
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
cbdeck2orb [-V] [-v] [-h] -p listenport -s sourcename -o orbname
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
cbdeck2orb listens on a user-specified port for an incoming connection
that will send a stream of comma delimited data values. Each instance
of cbdeck2orb accepts exactly one incoming connection and gathers data
from the logger. Data that is gathered is then scaled by a hardcoded
scaling factor, then bundled into an MGENC packet and submitted to the
user-defined orb. 

In order for this program to function the user must specify an orb to
send the data to.
.SH OPTIONS
.nf
-h, -v		print version and usage, then exit

-V		print verbose debugging information while running

-p listenport	listen for incomming connection on this port

-s sourcename   print the source name to submit for (ie. AAA_BBB).

-o $ORB		send data to this orb (required option)

-n nsamps	number of sets of samples to pack into one ORB MGENC packet

-r samplerate   number of samples per second that the data is at
