.SH NAME
handle-tornado-trap \- a Nagios SNMP trap handler for EonStar Tornado RAID 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
Usage: ./handle-tornado-trap
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
handle-tornado-trap is intended to be used as an SNMP trap event handler
for the Nagios network monitoring system (www.nagios.org). It can be
installed under the same process outlined in the Nagios manual for passive
SNMP trap collection. This generally involves making a passive, volitile
service for a host, running snmptrapd at boot, putting a traphandle
command in the /etc/snmptrapd.conf file, adding this handler to the
$NAGIOS_HOME/libexec/eventhandler directory, and using the submit script
included in the Nagios documentation.

.SH OPTIONS 
There are no command line options for this handler, but it expects to be 
fed input from STDIN. It should get the IP address on the first line, the 
hostname on the second, then the SNMP variable on the third. The Tornado 
unit only has one trap description with a single line of text containing 
name/value pairs. This handler parses through the variables to get the 
right parameters. 

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Since this handler is specific to the EonStar Tornado RAID system and its 
MIB (which may be shared throughout the product line), it will not be very 
functional with other RAID or SNMP units as-is.
