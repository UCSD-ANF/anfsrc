.SH NAME
nagios_check_orb_uptime \- a Nagios plugin to monitor ORB uptimes via pforbstat packets. 
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBnagios_check_orbuptime\fP \fB\-s\fP \fIsrc\fP [\fB\-v\fP]
           [\fB\-w\fP \fIwarn\fP \fB\-c\fP \fIcrit\fP] [\fB\-o\fP \fIorb\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBnagios_check_orb_uptime\fP is intended to be used as a plugin to
the Nagios network monitoring system (www.nagios.org). The plugin can
be installed with other plugins (usually in the Nagios libexec
directory or $ANTELOPE/bin) and called through the Nagios
configuration files. This tool uses \fBnagios_check_orbstat\fP to fetch
an ORB start time from a pforbstat packet. This time is then converted into
the length of time the orb has been up. 
.SH OPTIONS
.nf
Like all Nagios plugins, more detailed and recent help, argument
formats, etc. can be obtained via the -h option of the program.

Using the -o and -s options together will allow checking of a source
indirectly through another orb.

Source and ORB name strings will have the name and port translated via
dns and orbserver_names.pf ports into numeric IP address and
ports. The source must be a pforbstat feed, generally in the form of
"<host>:<port>/pf/orbstat".

This version also includes support for Nagios-style ranges for warning
and critical thresholds. According the the Nagios documentation, this
is as follows:

[@]start:end

Notes:
\- start > end>
\- start and ":" is not required if start=0
\- if range is of format "start:" and end is not specified,
   assume end is infinity
\- to specify negative infinity, use "~"
\- alert is raised if metric is outside start and end range
   (inclusive of endpoints)
\- if range starts with "@", then alert if inside this range
   (inclusive of endpoints)

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
This assumes that $ANTELOPE and other Antelope environment variables
have been set properly. This can be done in the startup script
for the Nagios system.
