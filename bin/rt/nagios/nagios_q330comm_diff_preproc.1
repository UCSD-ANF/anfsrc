.SH NAME
nagios_q330comm_diff_preproc \- put Nagios config files in the same format as q330comm tables 
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBnagios_q330comm_diff_preproc\fP is intended to be used as a preprocessor
for the diff tool. It sucks in a nagios host configuration file and a database
name (which must contain a .q330comm table) and prints them in a common
station name and ip address text format. diff can then be run on this file
to see what has changed.

.SH OPTIONS
This program does not take flags for options, but is particular about the order
of the arguments. The first is the filename of the nagios configuration file
to be examined. The second argument is the database name (a .q330comm will
be appended to it for the table name). The third option is the filename where
the nagios file's output will be dumped. The fourth option is the filename
where the table output will be dumped. Both output files will be summarily
overwritten, so watch your toes.

If the argument number is wrong, you will get a usage note, but that is all
the help the program will provide.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
This program is not very smart about the nagios config structure. It assumes
that the nagios file lists the stations of interest with a single word in
the alias (ie. A04A or TA_A04A). It also assumes that the alias comes
before the address listing in the file.
