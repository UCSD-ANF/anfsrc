.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBnagios_check_db_recent_image\fP is intended to be used as a plugin
to the Nagios network monitoring system (www.nagios.org). The plugin
can be installed with other plugins (usually in the Nagios libexec
directory or $ANTELOPE/bin) and called through the Nagios
configuration files. This tool looks in an images database to find the
age of the most recent image matching the supplied image name. It
requires that the database have a table named "images" with an
"imagename" field and a "time" field.

.SH OPTIONS
.nf
Like all Nagios plugins, more detailed and recent help, argument
formats, etc. can be obtained via the -h option of the program.

The argument for the source name should have the net, station, and
channel values in a single string with colon (':') delimiters. This
will look for the same net, station, and channel values that are tab
delimited in the status.txt file.

This version also includes support for Nagios-style ranges for warning
and critical thresholds. According the the Nagios documentation, this
is as follows:

[@]start:end

Notes:
\- start > end>
\- start and ":" is not required if start=0
\- if range is of format "start:" and end is not specified,
   assume end is infinity
\- to specify negative infinity, use "~"
\- alert is raised if metric is outside start and end range
   (inclusive of endpoints)
\- if range starts with "@", then alert if inside this range
   (inclusive of endpoints)

.fi
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The plugin will not work if the database format does not have an
"images" table with "imagename" and "time" fields holding the correct
data.
