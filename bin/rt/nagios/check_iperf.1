.SH NAME
check_iperf \- a Nagios plugin to monitor iperf bandwidth results 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
Usage: ./check_iperf -H <host> -p <port> [-s <window>] 
          [-w <warn> -c <crit>] [(-t <time> | -s <size>)]
          [-h help] [-V version] [-v verbose]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
check_iperf is intended to be used as a plugin to the Nagios network
monitoring system (www.nagios.org). The plugin can be installed with
other plugins (usually in the Nagios libexec directory) and called
through the Nagios configuration files. The plugin executes the iperf
program in client mode against a server that must be running the iperf
server. Measurements of bandwidth are made according to the parameters
given to the plugin. The results are then measured and reported to
Nagios.
.SH OPTIONS
.nf
Like all Nagios plugins, more detailed and recent help, argument
formats, etc. can be obtained via the -h option of the program.

This version also includes support for Nagios-style ranges for warning
and critical thresholds. According the the Nagios documentation, this
is as follows:

[@]start:end

Notes:
- start > end>
- start and ":" is not required if start=0
- if range is of format "start:" and end is not specified,
   assume end is infinity
- to specify negative infinity, use "~"
- alert is raised if metric is outside start and end range
   (inclusive of endpoints)
- if range starts with "@", then alert if inside this range
   (inclusive of endpoints)

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
It is possible to schedule an iperf test that takes longer than the
Nagios plugin time out value. In this case, the plugin will not return
in time and an error will be reported by Nagios. Be sure to run test
that are short enough or extend the plugin timeout value.
