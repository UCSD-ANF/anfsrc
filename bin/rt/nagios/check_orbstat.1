.SH NAME
check_orbstat \- a Nagios plugin to monitor values in pforbstat packets. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
Usage: ./check_orbstat -s <src>
           (-e | (-t <type> (-i <index>) -p <param>))
           [-w <warn> -c <crit>] [-o <orb>] [-v verbose]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
check_orbstat is intended to be used as a plugin to the Nagios network
monitoring system (www.nagios.org). The plugin can be installed with
other plugins (usually in the Nagios libexec directory) and called
through the Nagios configuration files. The plugin has two basic
modes.  The "exists" mode obtains the latest pforbstat packet and
checks to see how recent it is, comparing to warning and critical
ranges. The "value" mode (activated upon including type/index/param
values) will treat the packet as a pforbstat packet and dig through
the packet for a specific value. The value will then be compared to
the warning and critical thresholds. Used in combination with APAN or
another tool, this plugin could be used for performance measurements
and/or graphing.
.SH OPTIONS
.nf
Like all Nagios plugins, more detailed and recent help, argument
formats, etc. can be obtained via the -h option of the program.

Using the -o and -s options together will allow checking of a source
indirectly through another orb.

When checking /pf/orbstat sources, the source (specified as an
argument to -s) will have the name and port translated via dns and
orbserver_names.pf ports into numeric IP address and ports. This helps
doing a direct existance check for Nagios host groups.

This version also includes support for Nagios-style ranges for warning
and critical thresholds. According the the Nagios documentation, this
is as follows:

[@]start:end

Notes:
- start > end>
- start and ":" is not required if start=0
- if range is of format "start:" and end is not specified,
   assume end is infinity
- to specify negative infinity, use "~"
- alert is raised if metric is outside start and end range
   (inclusive of endpoints)
- if range starts with "@", then alert if inside this range
   (inclusive of endpoints)
