Usage: ./check_orbstat -s <src>

.SH DESCRIPTION
check_orbstat is intended to be used as a plugin to the Nagios network
monitoring system (www.nagios.org). The plugin can be installed with
other plugins (usually in the Nagios libexec directory) and called
through the Nagios configuration files. The plugin has two basic
modes.  The "exists" mode obtains the latest pforbstat packet and
checks to see how recent it is, comparing to warning and critical
thresholds. The "value" mode digs through the packet for a specific
value and compares that to warning and critical thresholds. Used in
combination with APAN or another tool, this plugin could be used for
performance measurements and/or graphing.
.SH OPTIONS
.nf
Like all Nagios plugins, more
detailed help can be obtained via the -h option of the program.

This version also includes support for Nagios-style ranges for warning
and critical thresholds. According the the Nagios documentation, this
is as follows:

[@]start:end

Notes:
- start > end>
- start and ":" is not required if start=0
- if range is of format "start:" and end is not specified,
   assume end is infinity
- to specify negative infinity, use "~"
- alert is raised if metric is outside start and end range
   (inclusive of endpoints)
- if range starts with "@", then alert if inside this range
   (inclusive of endpoints)
