.SH DESCRIPTION
check_orbstat is intended to be used as a plugin to the Nagios network
monitoring system (www.nagios.org). The plugin can be installed with
other plugins (usually in the Nagios libexec directory) and called
through the Nagios configuration files. The plugin has two basic
modes.  The "exists" mode obtains the latest pforbstat packet and
checks to see how recent it is, comparing to warning and critical
thresholds. The "value" mode digs through the packet for a specific
value and compares that to warning and critical thresholds. Used in
combination with APAN or another tool, this plugin could be used for
performance measurements and/or graphing.
.SH OPTIONS
