.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBnagios_check_status_txt\fP is intended to be used as a plugin to
the Nagios network monitoring system (www.nagios.org). The plugin can
be installed with other plugins (usually in the Nagios libexec
directory or $ANTELOPE/bin) and called through the Nagios
configuration files. This tool looks for a value of the specified
source in a user specified status.txt-formatted file of current 
source values collected by the triage program. The default status.txt
file is /var/Web/status.txt.

.SH OPTIONS
.nf
Like all Nagios plugins, more detailed and recent help, argument
formats, etc. can be obtained via the -h option of the program.

The argument for the source name should have the net, station, and
channel values in a single string with colon (':') delimiters. This
will look for the same net, station, and channel values that are tab
delimited in the status.txt file.

This version also includes support for Nagios-style ranges for warning
and critical thresholds. According the the Nagios documentation, this
is as follows:

[@]start:end

Notes:
\- start > end>
\- start and ":" is not required if start=0
\- if range is of format "start:" and end is not specified,
   assume end is infinity
\- to specify negative infinity, use "~"
\- alert is raised if metric is outside start and end range
   (inclusive of endpoints)
\- if range starts with "@", then alert if inside this range
   (inclusive of endpoints)

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The values obtained from the status.txt file are not checked for any
time values and may not necessarily be current, only listed in the
status.txt file.
