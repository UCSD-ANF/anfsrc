.TH ORB2SOCKET 1 "$Date: 2004/06/25 15:38:55 $"
.SH NAME
orb2socket \- take orb timeseries data and send it over a TCP socket in ASCII
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
orb2socket [-v] [-V] [-u] [-p tcpport] [-m matchstring ] [-w tcpwindow] [-o $ORB]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
orb2socket gathers data from the orb for use by other programs. orb2socket listens to a TCP/IP (4773 default) for an incoming connection. Once the connection arrives it reads a packet id or -1 from the connecting station. if it gets a pacekt id, it starts sending data after that packet id. If it gets a -1 it will send data from the beginning of the orb. What packets are sent is selected by the match string. If you want verbose console debugging use -v. If you want orb2socket to unstuff the packet and print it in a readable form, use -u. You may use -w tcpwindow to select the outgoing window size, so as to limit the data exposed to loss (although since packet ids are supported you can easily recover lost data).
