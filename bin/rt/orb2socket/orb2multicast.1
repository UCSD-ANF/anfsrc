.SH NAME
orb2multicast \- convert time series packets (Pkt_wf) to ASCII multicast data packets
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
orb2multicast  [-v] [-V] [-b] [-m matchname] [-r rejectname] [-a destaddr] [-p destport] [-o $ORB]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
orb2multicast gathers data from the orb and sends them via UDP, if you specify a multicast address, it will then multicast them. The output is human readable or easily parsed by a computer. There is no mechanism for retransmission but all packets that unstuff into time series data will be capable of being sent.
.SH OPTIONS
.nf
-V				print version and usage, then exit
-v				verbose mode
-b				binary multi-channel packet
-m matchname		srcname match string
-r rejectname		srcname mismatch string
-a maddr			multicast/unicast address to send packets too (default 
				233.7.117.79)
-p port			port to send UDP packets to (default 4000)
-o $ORB			orb to grab data from (default = ":")

8  - calibration (double) - multiply each value by this to get units
8  - timestamp (double) - number of seconds since epoch
8  - sample rate (double) - number of samples per second
4  - number of samples (network long int)              
4  - sample1 (network long int)                        
4  - sample2 (network long int)

 ...                                                   
4  - sample[number of samples] (network long int)

This format is one channel per packet. Any channel with data > MTU is
fragmented and reassembled by the IP layer.
