.SH NAME
nmea2orb \- capture NMEA-0183 strings and put them into orb packets
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
nmea2orb nmea_source port srcname orbname
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
nmea2orb connects to a TCP server that provides NMEA strings
and converts them into orb packets. The nmea_source is an 
IP address and port is the port-number of the server. The srcname
is the orb source-name for the packets and the orbname is the 
orbserver on which to put the output. 

nmea2orb timestamps the orb packets according to the system-clock time 
when the incoming packet is received.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The timestamping strategy of using the system clock may not be ideal
if some of the incoming strings have a more precise or appropriate time 
embedded within them. However, because not all NMEA strings contain such, 
this is hard to generalize. Full resolution of this might require a 
structured parameter-file for nmea2orb specifying the timestamping strategy 
(possibly with parsing information) for each incoming NMEA string type.
