.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBstation_aof_dumps\fP is designed to read a folder archive sent by the field personnel
and reorginize the files to fit the local conversion scripts. The expected format is:
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf
\fISOURCE_DIR\fI
	-BVLAOU
		-\fIfile1_sta1.bms\fI
		-\fIfile2_sta2.bms\fI
	-VLAOU
		-\fIfile3_sta1.bms\fI
		-\fIfile4_sta2.bms\fI
.fi
.ft R
.in
The structure will get reorginize into:
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf
\fIARCHIVE_DIR\fI
	-STA_1
		-BVLAOU
			-\fIfile1_sta1.bms\fI
		-VLAOU
			-\fIfile3_sta1.bms\fI	
	-STA_2
		-BVLAOU
			-\fIfile2_sta2.bms\fI
		-VLAOU
			-\fIfile4_sta2.bms\fI
.fi
.ft R

The script will first read the source directory and will select only matching directories. The 
regular expression for this match can be specified at the command line as a third 
argument after the archive directory. If omitted or dashed(-) it will default to \fB'BVLAOU|VLAOU'\fP.
The optional fourth argument is the regular expression for the names of the files. If
omitted or dashed(-) it will default to \fB'(C\d*_){!}(.+){1}\.bms(_\d*)?'\fP.

The script will strat reading the source directory and moving each file that matches the 
regex variables. 

The assumptions of the program are that:
.IP
The source directory is one level deep. 
.IP
Every file is archived only once. 
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
verbose
.IP -d
After each copy delete the file. Then remove the folders. Non-matching files  or folders will be omitted.
.IP -n
Test mode.  Does not delete, copy or move  any file or folder. 
.IP "-m mail_to"
email address list to send results.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
needs to have sourced $ANTELOPE/setup.csh.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.nf
rtmail(1)
.fi
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The script will only search one level down the tree. 
Format for regex expressions:
.IP
Folders: 'BVLAOU|VLAOU'
.IP
Files  : '(C\d*_)(.+)\.bms(_\d*)'
