.SH DESCRIPTION
map_changes is a command line utility that creates two temporary
files in /tmp (most_recent.dot, srcoutage.dat). 
These files are created with the aid of orbtopo_db. map_changes
runs continously and every 30 minutes (-c option) it checks for topology
changes or data sources that have not been updated recently.  If either
occurs it sends an email listing the culprits.  It depends on the following
applications:  graphviz and nail to do its dirty work.

orbtopo.cgi uses graphviz and a registry1.0 schema to generate a
topology image in gif format.  This program is run as a cgi script and
generates the topology on the fly. orbtopo_detail.cgi is a secondary web
script refered to by orbtopo.cgi.
.SH OPTIONS
.nf
-V				print usage and exit
-o orbname		orb to analyze (default ":")
-m match			match string on which srcnames are checked for latency
-r reject			reject string on which srcnames are checked for latency
-d tmpfiledir		where to place temporary files (default /tmp)
-n nailpath		path to the nail application, if not in regular path
-g graphvizpath	path to graphviz application, if not in regular path
-c checkinterval	how often to check status (default 30 min)

-t latencytimeout	number of minutes data must be delayed before we alert
				the user (default 180 min)

-s emailsubject	Network name for subject in email alerts 
				(default orbname)
