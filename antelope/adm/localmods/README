Antelope Localmods
==================

This directory is for local modifications to specific versions of antelope that
for whatever unknown reason can't live in the $ANF or similar tree. These are
typically unreleased patches for a specific version of Antelope.

These files tend to be rather version-specific, so the master "makefile" uses
the output of "getid id" to launch a second stage version-specific
Makefile-`getid id` make process.

See the comments at the top of makefile and the included Makefile-5.3.example

Example makefiles to apply mods for 5.3
=======================================

makefile
--------
This is an example top level `makefile` for this directory. For version 5.3,
it calls a second stage Makefile called `Makefile-5.3`.

```
all clean Include install installMAN pf relink tags uninstall :: FORCED
	@case `getid id` in \
		5.3) $(MAKE) -f Makefile-5.3 $@ ;; \
		*) echo "No pf_localmods for this release" ;; \
	esac
```

Makefile-5.3
------------

This second-stage Makefile will patch the `antelopemake` include file using an
os-specific copy of the file. It uses normal `antelopemakefile(5)` conventions.

It requires files named antelopemake-5.3.{Darwin,Solaris,Linux} to be in the
current directory.

```
INCLUDE = antelopemake
CLEAN = antelopemake

OS=`getid os`
include $(ANTELOPEMAKE)

antelopemake:
	cp antelopemake-5.3.`getid os` antelopemake
```
