wffilanf
========

Implementation of various filters for `wffil` processing. See the manpage
`wffilanf(3)` for details.

Usage
-----

This filter can be called directly, or you can call it as a
dynamically loadable filter from `wffil`. This assumes that you are using a
modified wffil.pf as detailed in `wffil(3)`.

This repository will install a properly tweaked wffil.pf to
`$ANF/data/pf/wffil.pf`. See anf/data/pf_localmods/wffil.pf for it's source.
