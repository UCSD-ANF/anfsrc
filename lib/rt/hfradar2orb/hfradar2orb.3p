.SH DESCRIPTION
These routines allow high-frequency radar files to be easily ingested 
into an orbserver, and also recorded in a tracking database. 

The open_tracking_database routine opens up a database in the schema
specified by hfradar2orb_pm.pf, returning a database pointer to the database. 
If the database does not yet exist, it is created by this routine.

The record_file routine records filenames in this database, according
to the format given. The $format should be one of the entries in
hfradar2orb_pm.pf, e.g. "rcdrr1.0". The file given by the pathname $file
should be in its final location before calling this routine,
since record_file will deduce the file's absolute path in order to
record it in the database.  The $epoch value is the Unix epoch timestamp
corresponding to the radar data values in the file.

The encapsulate_packet routine places the file on the orb, which should 
be specified as a file descriptor to an orb opened with write permissions. 
The file should actually be read into a string-variable buffer before 
being passed to the routine. The rest of the arguments are similar to
those of record_file. For packet formats that support it, large packets 
(defined as those larger than $hfradar2orb::Max_packet_size) will be split
into multiple packets before being placed on the orb. 

The $hfradar2orb::Verbose variable may be set to a non-zero value 
in order to request detailed output messages (via the elog_notify(3) function)
about the progress of the routines. 

The formats table of the hfradar2orb_pm.pf parameter file is available 
as the Perl hash %hfradar2orb::Formats. 

The max_packet_size parameter of the hfradar2orb_pm.pf parameter file is available
as the Perl variable $hfradar2orb::Max_packet_size. This indicates 
the largest packet which should be put on the target orbserver, and is 
usually set to coincide with ORB_MAX_DATA_BYTES of antelopeenv(5).

Finally, the routine hfradar2orb::mdyhms2epoch is a small utility routine
to convert numeric month,day,year,hour,minute,second values into the Unix 
epoch time required by the encapsulate_packet and record_file routines.

.SH EXAMPLE
.in 2c
.ft CW
The example below shows a synthetic file of CODAR data being place on 
an orbserver and also being placed in a Datascope database. The time, formats,
etc are hard-wired in this example for illustrative purposes. 
.nf
: # use perl
eval 'exec $ANTELOPE/bin/perl -S $0 "$@"'
if 0;

use lib "$ENV{ANTELOPE}/data/perl" ;
use Datascope;
use orb;
use hfradar2orb;

$orbname = ":";
$dbname = "hfradartest";

$hfradar2orb::Verbose++;

$file = "junk";
$net = "FAKE";
$site = "JUNK";
$format = "rcdrr1.0";
$patterntype = "-";
$m = 7;
$d = 22;
$y = 2004;
$h = 15;
$M = 24;
$s = 03;

$epoch = hfradar2orb::mdyhms2epoch( $m,$d,$y,$h,$M,$s );

elog_init( $0, @ARGV );

$orbfd = orbopen( $orbname, "w" );
@db = hfradar2orb::open_tracking_database( $dbname );

hfradar2orb::encapsulate_packet( $file, $site, $patterntype, $format, $epoch, $orbfd );
hfradar2orb::record_file( $file, $net, $site, $patterntype, $format, $epoch, @db );

orbclose( $orb );
dbclose( @db );

Running this produces:

% go
go: Sent 'junk' to orb, timestamped  7/22/04 07:24:03.000 AKDT
go: Adding 'junk' to database, timestamped  7/22/04 07:24:03.000 AKDT

.SH RETURN VALUES
The encapsulate_packet and record_file routines return 0 for success, -1 
upon error. 

The open_tracking_database routine returns a database-pointer to the open 
database. 

The mdyhms2epoch routine returns an epoch time corresponding to the 
input values.

.fi
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
If the only thing that changes about a file is the patterntype from which 
it was constructed, the record_file routine will not update the record.

The support for totalfiles may have been broken by the upgrade to the 
Hfradar0.5 schema. This can be repaired should real-time transport of 
total files become necessary.
