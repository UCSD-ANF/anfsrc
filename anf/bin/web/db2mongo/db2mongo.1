.TH DB2MONGO 1
.SH NAME

db2mongo \- populate MongoDB with metadata information

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBdb2mongo\fR [-c] [-v] [-d] [-p parameter_file]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
Track a database with information about stations and update
a joined view of all parameters in a MongoDB collection. The
tool will attempt to read the list of sites from a \fIdeployment\fR
table. In case we don't have a \fIdeployment\fR table then we use the
\fIsite\fR table.
After reading the deployment table we have several options in the PF
file to pull different types of information to join with the base
information. After we build the original view and update the collection
the system will track the checksum of every Antelope table used and
routinely verify if this checksum changes. If any change is detected then
the view gets rebuild and the information pushed to the collection.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB-c\fR
Clean the collection of any previous entries before we start updating it.

.IP \fB-v\fR
Run in verbose mode.

.IP \fB-d\fR
Debug mode.

.IP "\fB-p\fR pf_file"
Parameter file to use.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The tool should only look at the database and only static information should
be handled by it. Unfortunately we are missing the tools that will track ORBs
and real-time information so for now we do have some functions that will handle
ORB data in this tool. This is added to the loop that tracks the checksums of the
tables.
