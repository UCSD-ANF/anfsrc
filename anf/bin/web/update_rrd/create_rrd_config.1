.TH CREATE_RRD_CONFIG 1
.SH NAME

create_rrd_config \- Create parameter files for orb2rrdc instances

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBcreate_rrd_config\fR
or
\fBcreate_rrd_config\fR im
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
This script will make the process of creating PF files for orb2rrdc
easy. The configuration parameters are all hardcoded. The idea is that
you have a 3 variables to modify. One will set the different types of
values that you want to track. It is set to track [max, min, average]
for all databases. Then you set the different time-windows that you
need. In this case each value will create a new archive. For prelim
systems we only have a week and a month. For regular system values
we have also a year and several years. The last parameter is how
many points we want in the archive. The main goal of the code is to
calculate the different steps required for each archive. This is done
based on the expected number of points for each data type.

We have 2 main data types. The primary is the pf/st packets that will
bring data at 1sps. This is easy because it is produced by the datalogger
and it's very regular. The second type is for the pf/im packets that we
get from Intermapper. In those the samplerate is variable and can be as
short as 10 mins or big as 1 hour. This makes the configuration challenging.

The most important part is for you to modify the heartbeat and the step in
the configuration to avoid loosing data on variable samplerate streams. If
you get less data points than the tolerance then you may loose all data
points in that segment.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fBim\fR
Run with this argument if you want to produce a configuration for pf/im packets.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The PF configuration will be printed to screen and you have to copy/past the
text to a file or pipe the output directly.
