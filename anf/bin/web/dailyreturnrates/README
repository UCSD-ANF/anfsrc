DECOMMISSIONED:

The function of reading the NetPerf tables and updating
JSON files on the web jsoncahce directory was migrated
to the new _db2mongo_ framework. The new module netperf_class.py
is in charge of reading the databases and updating the MongoDB
instance with the information. dailyreturnrate2json is not in
use anymore.
