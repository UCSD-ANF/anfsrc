.SH ROTATION_COMPARISON
rotation_comparison \- compare orientation of station(s) sensor(s) to a reference station sensor

.SH DESCRIPTION
This script is used to compare the orientation of a sensor or sensors at the given station to the orientation of a reference sensor. 
Data for the sensors and reference sensor are demeaned, integrated to units of position, calibrated, and then frequency filtered to 
remove out any instrument response signal. For each station in station list, data is rotated and cross-correlated with the reference station
data. The angle that produces the great cross-correlation coefficient is the rotation angle between the sensors. The results are printed to screen. 
If noplot is False, the unrotated data and rotated data are plotted.  

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB-h, --help\fR"
Print description on command lines arguments.
.IP "\fB-v, --verbose\fR"
Verbose output. 
.IP "\fB-o, --evid\fR"
The 2nd argument in command-line is an ORID not TIME
.IP "\fB-x   \fR"
Debug data processing. Makes an image on every station rotation calculation and waits for user review.
.IP "\fB--noplot   \fR"
Do not plot orientation results
.IP "\fB-f FILTER, --filter=FILTER\fR"
Use the quoted text as filter instead of option from PF file. ie. \fBBW 0.02 4 0.05 4\fP
.IP "\fB-p PF, --pf=PF\fR"
Override the default parameter-file \fBdbmoment.pf\fP
.IP "\fB-c CHANNEL, --chan=CHANNEL\fR"
Use the quoted text as chan instead of option from PF file. ie. \fBBW EH.*\fP
.IP "\fB-t TIMEWINDOW, --tw=TIMEWINDOW\fR"
Use the quoted text as tw instead of option from PF file. ie. \fBBW EH.*\fP

.IP "\fB-s SELECT, --select=SELECT\fR"
String to subset the list of stations to use. Regex form. ie. \fBSTA1|STA2|STA3\fP
.IP "\fB-r REFERENCE, --reference=SELECT\fR"
String of stations to use for reference. ie. \fBSTA1\fP

.SH PARAMETER FILE
Some important values from the parameter file:

.IP \fIimage_dir\fP
All results will produce an image that will be archived in this folder.


.IP \fIchan\fP
Channels which are used

.IP \fIfilter\fP
Butterworth filter which is used to filter data


.IP \fItime_window\fP
Time window to extract data
