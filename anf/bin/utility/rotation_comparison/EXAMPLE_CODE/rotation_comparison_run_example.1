.TH ROTATION_COMPARISON_RUN_EXAMPLE 1

.SH NAME
rotation_comparison_run_example \- run rotation_comparison on 2 different data sets

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrotation_comparison_run_example\fP [temp_dir]

.SH DESCRIPTION
This script is runs an example of rotation_comparison code. \fBrotation_comparison\fP is
used to compare the orientation of a sensor or sensors at the given station to the
orientation of a reference sensor. The example provided is for a single station with two
sensors. \fBtrdisp\fP of horizontal waveforms will show the sensors are rotated approximately
180 degrees apart. \fBrotation_comparison_run_example\fP calculates this rotation angle
and stores the result in a table and figure. The database and tables are not altered.

Example 1 is of station TUL3 with two co-located sensors. Channels BH.* (e.g. BHZ)
correspond to a borehole sensor and BH._.. (e.g. BHZ_01) correspond to near-surface sensor. 
Reviewing waveforms indicates the sensors are rotated ~180 degrees from one another.
A parameter file is included in the directory with correct specifications for this example.

Example 2 is of station TRO (AZ Network) with two co-located sensors. Channels HN.* (e.g. HNZ)
correspond to an accelerometer episensor and channels HH.* (e.g. HHZ) correpsonds to a 
STS-2 broadband sensor. The accelerometer waveforms were 1-2.5 degrees degrees difference orientation prior to a manual
45 degree rotation added to demonstrate \fBrotation_comparison\fI accuracy in assessing the rotation
angle. A parameter file is included in the directory with correct specifications for this example.

.SH ENVIRONMENT AND DEPENDENCIES
You need to have $ANF defined in your environment. Then
compile the source code.

    make clean;
    make;
    make install;

It will require write access to the example folder:

    $ANF/example/rotation_comparison/

OR...  you can run with a possible argument for a
work folder that the process will use to create
some tables that will link to the ones in the
main distribution. You need to do this if you
don't have write access to $ANF folder.

.SH PARAMETER FILE
None.

.SH EXAMPLE
You can run the rotation_comparison code by hand from any directory.

Run directly in terminal:

    rotation_comparison_run_example

This will go to the example folder "$ANF/example/rotation_comparison/" and
will run both examples. You will see several new folders within the example folders.

    rotation_comparison_images => Default folder to save the results in PNG files.
