.SH CODE LIMITATIONS
The Second Moment calculation tool in this distribution is an automated version,
with an optional interactive tool, of Jeff McGuire's Second Moment Estimation routine. 
As described in \fIMcGuire (2017)\fP, this routine works best with a dense seismic dataset
on local/regional events with magnitudes 3<Mw<6 without the assumptions of other typical
corner-frequency approaches.

The software uses empirical Green's function (EGF) deconvolution to calculate the apparent
source time function (ASTF). A smaller aftershock is used for the EGF. If the origin of the aftershock
is not provided, second_moment will select all possible origins that satisfy conditions set in
the parameter file. The routine needs to be improved to select the best possible EGF origin. Without proper
EGF selection, the results may not be accurate representations of the source properties.
In this early distribution, the routine will work best if a good known aftershock is manually set. 

Second_moment calculates the ASTF for waveforms that have arrivals for both the main origin and EGF.
Therefore, the station distribution is limited by quality and quantity of station arrivals.
The input origin and potential EGF origins should be well-reviewed events to ensure
good azimuthal coverage. If final result indicates poor coverage, check quantity and quality
of arrivals and improve if necessary.  

.SH RECOMMENDED FEATURES/IMPROVEMENTS
1) Remove the dependency of arrivals utilizing cross-correlation. If this results
in large errors, remove the dependency for the interactive (-i) option where
arrivals are manually selected anyways.

2) Require high SNR for arrivals

3) Require a threshold moment ratio between main shock and aftershock (recommended is 1000)

4) Use enveloping to select best window for ASTF calculation. Current P-wave window utilizes
P-S time and S-wave window is fixed.

5) Nearest-neighbor technique for removing poor ASTF calculation. Require results that have
nearest-neighbors with similar tauc and moments.

6) Remove ASTF results with > 3 peaks. These are often not thrown out using current misfit thresholds.

7) Improve results figure

8) Possible storage of results in a database table

9) Set threshold for variance reduction and quality of results

.SH DATABASE REQUIREMENTS
The code requires some information about the stations, the event(s) that
will be processed, and the actual data files. The list of tables that are
required by the code:
    arrival
    assoc
    event
    instrument
    mt (if --fault not used)
    netmag
    origin
    sensor
    site
    wfdisc

.SH SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
The code requires Antelope and a program \fItopp\fP provided in matlab directory.
\fItopp\fP requires fcc and gfortran to run. \fItopp\fP was taken directly from
the hypoDD software package and included in McGuire's original routine.
 
.SH ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
Second moment source properties were computed using routines described and provided in
\fIMcGuire (2017)\fP. \fItopp\fP was used to calculate the partial derivates for
the inversion. This subroutine was included in McGuire's original routine and taken directly
from the hypoDD software package (\fIWaldhauser and Ellsworth, 2000\fP).
 
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBsecond_moment\fP application calculates the second moment for a given origin id (\fIorid\fP)
for stations with arrivals associated with both the event and selected egf (aftershock) event.
The second moment describes the spatial extent of the rupture area (\fIL_c and W_c\fP),
the duration of rupture (\fItauc\fP), and rupture propogation (\fIv0\fP and \fImv0\fP). The
corresponding errors can be determined through a jackknifing method (\fIdojackknife=1\fP).
The corresponding confidence limits can be determined via bootstrapping (\fIdobootstrap=1\fP).

The \fBsecond_moment\fP routine is a wrapper around McGuire's second moment estimation
MATLab Routine (\fIMcGuire, 2017\fP). The wrapper automates the selection of EGF aftershock, stations, and
arrival times utilizing the MATLab interface to Antelope. The ASTF for each arrival/waveform is calculated 
automatically (unless -i flag). Only the optimum ASTF results are selected as data for the
inversion. This is determined by  misfit value, L-curve sharpness, and moment deviation from the mean.
Once the optimum ASTF measurements are determined, the inversion, jackknifing, and bootstrapping are run.
The ASTF calculation, partial derivative determination using \fItopp\fP, inversion method, jacknifing,
and bootstrapping routines are directly from McGuire's routine.

.SH EXAMPLE
McGuire's original code contained an example dataset for users to test the code.
The example is described in detail in \fIMcGuire (2017)\fP. 

You can run the example by simply using the command:

     \fBsecond_moment_run_example\fP


.SH CODE STEPS
First step for second_moment is for the code to open the given database and
extract all event information from the origin, event, netmag, and mt tables
and identify the stations needed. With this information, a list of possible
egf origins are selected based on criteria set in the parameter file. The
corresponding arrivals for both the main shock (ms) origin and egf origin
are extracted.

The code will then extract velocity traces for each selected arrival for both the ms
and egf origins. Other waveform parameters (e.g. samplerate) are extracted as well.
Using the arrival time and set windowing technique (P-S time for P-wave, fixed for S-wave),
the ASTF is calculated using the technique described in \fIMcGuire (2017)\fP.

For arrivals corresponding to the same station, the arrival with the better ASTF result
is used. This is determined by a combination of misfit, L-curve sharpness, and deviation
of the moment from the mean moments. After all ASTF measurements are complete, the code
will throw out any results that have misfit > misfit_criteria or deviate too far (1.5sd) from
the mean moment. 

These measurements are input as d in the inverse problem Gm=d. The partial derivatives are
calculated for the given fault plane (strike1,dip1 if testfault=0) using take-off angles
calculated with \fItopp\fP. The inversion is run and second moment characteristics,
including rupture time, propogation velocity, length, and width, are determined. The
variance reduction is calculated and can be used to assess quality of result.

If dojackknife is set to 1, the code will run a jackknifing method to determine
the error bars of the second moment characteristics. If dobootstrap is set to 1,
the code will run a bootstrapping method to determine the confidence limits of
the second moment characteristics.

Every run (except if running --no_figure) will produce plots of each ASTF measurement,
a map of tauc (d in Gm=d) measurements relative to the event, and a final image with
the second moment properties, rupture ellipse on the fault plane, tauc measurements,
and Gm (best fits) measurements. 

The current version of the code does not update any tables with the results. This could
be added in later versions.
