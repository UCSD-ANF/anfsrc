.TH SECOND_MOMENT_RUN_EXAMPLE 1

.SH NAME
second_moment_run_example \- run second_moment on 1 example event

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsecond_moment_run_example\fP [temp_dir]

.SH DESCRIPTION
McGuire's second_moment inversion source code has been automated and 
included in anfsrc repos as well as 1 full example from the original code. 
The data needed for the example is located in "EXAMPLE_1" folder. 

Inversion will have the same limitations as McGuire's original code. 
Users can familiarize themselves with the program by reviewing \fIMcGuire (2017)\fP.

.SH ENVIRONMENT AND DEPENDENCIES
You need to have $ANF defined in your environment. Then
compile the source code.

    make clean;
    make;
    make install;

It will require write access to the example folder:

    $ANF/example/second_moment/

OR...  you can run with a possible argument for a
work folder that the process will use to create
some tables that will link to the ones in the
main distribution. You need to do this if you
don't have write access to $ANF folder.

.SH PARAMETER FILE
None.

.SH EXAMPLE
You can run the second_moment code by hand from any directory.

Run directly in terminal:

    second_moment_run_example

This will go to the example folder "$ANF/example/second_moment/" and
will run both examples. You will see several new folders.

    second_moment_images => Default folder to save the results in PNG files.
