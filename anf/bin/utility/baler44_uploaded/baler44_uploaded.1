.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbaler44_uploaded\fP migrates files from the remote uploads to permanent archives.
Desing to run out of crontab and email results. The script will lList files in the source
directory and migrates the data to the target directory. The source
directory gets data from the automatic uplaod GUI run by AOF (Allan) and
a PHP script at anf.ucsd.edu saves the data in a temp folder.

The script will strat reading the source directory and moving each file into its station directory
on the target directory. If the folder is missing the script will create one. If the folder for
the checksums is missing the scirpt will create a folder "md5" inside the target directory.

The assumptions of the program are that:
.IP
The source directory is one level deep and include folders with the names of the stations. 
.IP
Every file for the station is in the station folder. No matching for station name is performed at 
this time. That was done at uplaod time.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
verbose
.IP -n
Test mode/dry run.  Does not delete, copy or move  any file or folder.
.IP "-m mail_to"
email address list to send results.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
needs to have sourced $ANTELOPE/setup.csh.

.SH "SEE ALSO"

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The script will only search one level down the tree.
The script will try to put the files in the same station name folder
that they are found. If the folder is not found then the files will
go to a "./temp" destination folder in the TARGET path. This will avoid
recreating directories from archives migrated out of the system.
