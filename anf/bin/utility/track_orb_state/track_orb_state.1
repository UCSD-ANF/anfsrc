.SH NAME
track_orb_state \- Simple python script to parse orbstat output
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBtrack_orb_state\fR [-j] host:orb [host:orb] ...
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Very simple Python script to parse the string output of a shell
call to orbstat for each one of the listed orbs in the command
line. The call will have the -v and -c flags so we get the
latency of every connection in that orb. Then we print
to screen every listed connection with it's respective
latency value.

We can also run with the -j flag and get the output in a JSON
object that could be parsed by any other tool. The JSON
string will look like this:


{
    "anfexport:status": {
        "status": "taexport.ucsd.edu:/export/home/rt/rtsystems/exchange (169.228.44.56), port #30896",
        "orbs": [
            {
                "timeUnits": "seconds",
                "state": "ok",
                "orbname": "    orb2orb :status taexport.ucsd.edu:status -m .*/pf/im",
                "time": "1.140"
            },
            {
                "timeUnits": "seconds",
                "state": "ok",
                "orbname": "    orb2orb taexport.ucsd.edu:status :status -m .*/pf/.*|.*/MST.?",
                "time": "1.140"
            }
        ]
    }
}
