.SH DESCRIPTION
Very simple Python script to parse the string output of a shell
call to orbstat for each one of the listed orbs in the command
line. The call will have the -v and -c flags so we get the
latency of every connection in that orb. Then we print
to screen every listed connection with it's respective
latency value.
