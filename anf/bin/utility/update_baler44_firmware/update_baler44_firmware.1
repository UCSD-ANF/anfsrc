connections. Needs database with staq330 table to run automatically or
needs submit each IP by hand in interactive mode. In automatic database
mode you can specify a regex for select or a regex for reject for the
stations in the staq330 table. If the -n flag is used then the firts ssh
to the station will make sure that the /mnt/admin directory is in place
and will query the status page for the current firmware version. It will
stop before uploading the new firmwasre to the baler.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
The software need the perl library "Expect" for the connections. If not present in the system the module
can be downloaded from CPAN. The software will run ssh and scp as system calls and they need to be 
present on the PATH of the system. The path of the firmware file and database will get converted to 
absolute paths internally. The database needs table "staq330" but it should not be listed on the 
command option. The software will expand the path and will search for the table.
Username and passwords will default to "root2":"root2". The port for the ssh and the scp is set to
port 5386 and there is no way to specify that on the flags. The script may not be produce the correct output
after an error on the ssh or scp connection. I'm getting the "denied", "closed", "timeout" and "EOF" flags 
but we migth get others. The script will clean the admin directory of any files that match  /b44update-*.tar.jz.asc/
