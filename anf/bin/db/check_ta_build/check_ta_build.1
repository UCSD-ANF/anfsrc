.TH CHECK_TA_BUILD 1 
.SH NAME
check_ta_build \- various TA-specific checks against the metadata and q3302orb pf files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBcheck_ta_build \fP [-1|-2|-3|-4|-5] [-p pf] [-t targetname] [-v] db  
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
After building an updated TA-only dbmaster, it is often useful to verify that
what data you expect to be collected is being collected via \fBq3302orb\fR and
that you have not introduced a mismatch between the q330 serial numbers in the 
acquisition parameter files and the metadata.  These verifications help improve
acquisition operations as well as web functions and displays.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP db
This is a required argument.  This is the name of the descriptor file which points
to the metadata you want to review.  A network, calibration, site, stage, snet, 
schanloc, and dlsensor table are required.
.IP "-p parameterfile"
Use an alternate parameter file.  The default pf is \fIcheck_ta_build.pf\fP.
.IP "-t target"
A targetname that identifies particular instances of \fBq3302orb\fP.  This can be
wildcarded so that multiple targets can be reviewed for out of range mass positions.  This is an
optional argument and can be used to limit the number of <targetname>/pf/st packets
to review.  The default targetname is all targetnames aka ".*".
.IP -v
Be more verbose.
.IP -1
Run only test #1.  This checks that the number of open stations in the metadata
corresponds to the number of open stations in the q3302orb parameter files.
.IP -2
Run only test #2.  This checks that all stations with HH channels (100sps) 
being collected via a named template, have HH channels described in the 
metadata and that all HH channels open in the metadata are being collected
with a proper datalogger template in use. The datalogger templates used 
in your q3302orb pf files that collect 100sps data must be listed in the 
\fIbb100\fP section of the parameter file.
.IP -3
Run only test #3.  This checks that all stations with HN channels (100sps strong motion) 
being collected via a named template, have HN channels described in the 
metadata and that all open HN channels are being collected with a proper
datalogger tempate in use. The datalogger templates used in your q3302orb pf 
files that collect 100sps strong motion data must be listed in the \fIhn\fP 
section of the parameter file.
.IP -4
Run only test #4.  This test looks to see if the start times for the broadband, 
strong motion, and met channels are the same.  This would be true for stations 
where all instruments were put in place at station install, but can vary for 
the older TA stations (met was not initially available).  Because there are 
many stations where it is known that there was an offset in sensor installs, the
\fIcheck_ta_build.pf\fP contains an exclusion list of stations.  Modify \fIskip_starttime_check\fP
as needed to exclude stations that trigger this error that you have verified have
offsets in sensor installation times.
.IP -5
Run only test #5.  This test compares the q3302orb parameter file values of dlsta and 
q330 serial number with the values in dlsensor and stage.ssident.
.SH FILES
.SH ENVIRONMENT
Must have sourced Antelope setup.sh/setup.csh.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
.IP select_packets
Expression used for selecting packets to review for the q330 information.  An alternate
way to express a targetname subset.
.IP reject_packets
Expression used for rejecting packets to review for the q330 information.  An alternate
way to express a targetname subset.
.IP orbs
Orbs which contain the status (.*pf/st) packets to review.
.IP bb100
List of datalogger templates described in the q3302orb parameter files which are
in use to collect broadband 100sps (HH channel) data.
.IP hn
List of datalogger templates described in the q3302orb parameter files which are
in use to collect strong motion 100sps (HN channel) data.
.IP skip_starttime_check
Stations which have been verified to have offsets in start times for the broadband,
strong motion and/or inframet channels of data.
.SH EXAMPLE
.IP \(bu
Check all available stations for mismatches in start/endtimes between the broadband,
strong motion, and met channels.

be collecting 100sps broadband data and what stations are actually setup to collect
100sps broadband data via q3302orb.

The above indicates that there is definitely a problem and you would need to verify
whether the q3302orb.pf needs to be updated for the station - such that it is using
the correct template that would collect 100sps HH data, or alternatively figure out 
why the HH records are open in the metadata if there is no 100sps data to collect.
