.TH AEC_TAPICK_REVIEW 1
.SH NAME
aec_TApick_review \- subset AEC bulletin for user specified time window and magnitude, only for events with stations included in TA footprint 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBaec_TApick_review \fR [-v] [-p pf] [-X {start end}]

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBaec_TApick_review\fR subsets the externally reviewed (by AEC)
database based on user input for a specified time window and magnitude.
The output database will have a name like \fIaecfull_YYYYJJ1_YYYYJJ2_gt3_0\fP.
The newly created database is used as input (via the 'oe' command) to a dbpick scan 
of the usarray database.  In this step, the analyst looks for events that 
should have arrivals added and if any such events are found, the \fBaec_add_arrivals\fP 
script is run to add the reviewed arrivals.  See https://anf.ucsd.edu/wiki/display/general/post-review+processing+notes
for additional information on procedures.
.LP
There are two operational modes:  interactive or expert.  In the default 
interactive mode, the user is prompted for input and output databases,
magnitude cutoff, and date range.  In expert mode, triggered with \fI-X\fP,
the parameter file needs to have the correct database paths specified and 
the start and end dates must be given on the command line.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP  -v
Verbose output.
.IP  -p pf
Parameter file.  Default is \fBaec_TApick_review.pf\fP.  This must have correct 
databases if the \fI-X\fP option is used.
.IP  -X
Use expert mode.  
.IP  start
Start time for reviewed output database
.IP  end 
End time for reviewed output database
.SH EXAMPLE
\(bu Use the interactive mode to get reviewed AEC origins and arrivals for July 2015.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
The \fBlast_origin_lddate\fP is very chatty and will spew output even without
the \fI-v\fP option chosen.
.LP
If you run this script for a second time without removing the previously created 
aecfull_YYYYJJ1_YYYYJJ2_gt3_0 database, it will fail as it does not append or
overwrite previously exisiting database tables.
