file_mode : store all computed time fields on disk, not in memory
            this saves memory in case many sources have to be computed

no_pp_mode : do ray tracing immediately after FMM for each source,
             and deallocate all memory related to the source before
             starting on the next.
             This excludes the computation of late reflections because
             this requires the travel time fields of two sources to be 
             available at the same time

parallel_mode : set if sources are distributed over different machines.
                A script is required to copy over the required input files
                to each machine and start up instances of the fm3d code.

display_mode : generate OpenDX visualization files 

save_rays_mode : save the ray paths in the file rays.dat

save_timefields_mode : save the arrival times on the nodes of the regular 
                       grid in arrtimes.dat. For paths involving interface
                       crossings there will always be ambiguities. For now
                       we take the minimum arrival time at each node from
                       all timefields crossing the region.
