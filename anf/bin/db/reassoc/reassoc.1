.SH DESCRIPTION
This script will consolidate arrivals from duplicate origins and associate them
with a single origin. It was written because there was an apparent bug in dbloc2
which did not allow more than 400 arrivals to be associated with a single origin.
For large teleseismic events recorded by the TA, the total number of P and S
picks frequently exceeds this number. The workaround was to associate P picks
and S picks separately, but to identical solutions. This script would then be
run to consolidate arrivals to be associated with a single origin row. This bug
may have been resolved, and may have been an environment issue to begin with.
This script may be obsolete.
