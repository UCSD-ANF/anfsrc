.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBaec_add_arrivals\fR \fIAECpickdb\fP \fITAoutputdb\fP \fIorid\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBaec_add_arrivals\fR adds arrivals from an externally reviewed (by AEC)
database to an output TA-analyst reviewed database based on an orid 
from the AEC reviewed database.  This is the second portion of the review
procedures for a TA analyst reviewing events located within Alaska (working at 
a one week or longer delay from real-time).  Prior to running this script, 
the analyst should have run \fBaec_TApick_review\fR and scanned using dbpick.  
See https://anf.ucsd.edu/wiki/display/general/post-review+processing+notes
for additional information on procedures..
.SH OPTIONS
.IP AECpickdb
The name of the database containing arrivals reviewed by AEC analysts.  This 
is normally the output database from the \fBaec_TApick_review\fR script and will
have a name like \fIaecfull_YYYYJJ1_YYYYJJ2_gt3_0\fP
.IP TAoutputdb
The name of the database containing all usarray picks, likely the monthly
database undergoing review (i.e. \fIusarray_YYYY_mm\fP).
.IP orid
The origin id from the \fIAECpickdb\fP for the event to be added.  When scanning 
with dbpick after using the "oe" option, this orid should show up in the text of
the dbpick information window.
.SH EXAMPLE
When scanning, orid 12795 is found to have clear arrivals from the AEC, but none
in the usarray database.  Add those AEC arrivals to the usarray database.
