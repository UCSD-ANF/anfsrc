<description>
This probe runs the nagios_check_q330_ping Nagios plugin to send Quanterra Data Protocol ping packets to a Q330 to check for Q330 responsivness and packet loss along the data path.  The number of pings to send and corresponding loss thresholds are specified in the probe parameters. Thresholds are specified as a percent of packets lost. Using \${ADDRESS} for the hostname will pass the device address to the probe.

The probe parameters are:

Hostname - The name of the hosts to be checked
Packets  - The number of ping packets to sent to the host
Alarm    - The percentage of ping packets lost out of the total sent that sets an alarm status
Critical - The percentage of ping packets lost out of the total sent that sets an down status
