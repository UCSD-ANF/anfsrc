<description>
This probe runs the nagios_check_orblag Nagios plugin to check for clients that
 are not reading at the tip of the orb.

The check is executed from the Intermapper server. It uses the address assigned
 to the probe object, checking the requested \MOrbport\P

\B\Parameters:\P\

\MB\Orbport\P\ - The Antelope port name or number to check. Can be any valid
name as defined in \I\orbserver_names.pf\P\

\MB\Alarm\P\ and \MB\Critical\P\ - Lag threshold to set an alarm or Critical
state. Values must be between 0 and 1, expressed as a decimal number.
\MB\Alarm\P\ defaults to \I\0.01\P\. \MB\Critical\P\ defaults to \I\0.2\P\

\MB\Match\P\ and \MB\Reject\P\ - Regular expressions for either matching or rejecting hosts based on their hostname.

\B\Note:\P\ Due to how Intermapper strips quotes from a command, you have to specify a \I\Match\P\ statement even if it's the default of \I\.*\P\. It's ok to leave \I\Reject\P\ empty.
