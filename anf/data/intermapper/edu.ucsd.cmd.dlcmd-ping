<description>
The \b\Dlcmd pingt \p\probe uses the Antelope dlcmd program to check if a
target datalogger acquisition instance \i\Target\p\ of type \i\Dltype\p\ is
listening on the given command orb \i\Orbport\p\.

\b\Parameters:\p\

\i\Timeout\p\ - How long dlcmd will wait for a response in seconds. This can
usually be a short interval for a pingt. \b\Note:\p\ if you are using a
wildcard for \i\Targets\!i\, you will want to tune the \b\Response Time\!b\
settings under \b\Thresholds\!b\ for the device to be greater than this value.

\i\Orbport\p\ - The Antelope port name or number. This can be any entry in
 \u\orbserver-names.pf\p\ or a number.

\i\Targets\p\ - This is a regular UNIX expression that will match against data
acquisition program target names to determine which target acquisition
programs will respond to the command.  This is a required argument. If this is
set to \b\-\p\ then it is treated as matching all target names.

\i\Dltypes\p\ - This  is  a regular UNIX expression that will match against
datalogger types to determine which target acquisition programs will respond to
the command.  This is a required argument. If this is set to \b\-\p\ then it is
treated as matching all datalogger types. Currently, the datalogger types that
are recognized are \u\altus\p\, for Kinemetrics Altus dataloggers, \u\qt\p\,
for older Quanterra MULTISHEAR dataloggers and \u\q330\p\, for newer Quanterra
Q330-series dataloggers.

\b\Example Settings:\p\

To verify that a q3302orb instance called 'tadataAG' is listening, set
\i\Targets\p\ to \b\tadataAG\p\ and \i\Dltypes\p\ to \b\q330\p\.

The default settings of \b\-\p\ for \i\Targets\p\ and \i\Dltypes\p\ will check
to see if anything at all responds.
