#Pf file for db2sync

# Required Sync file fields are Network, Station, Channel, 
# Time, Endtime.  They are missing from the pf file because 
# all usable sync files must have those fields filled in.  
# Db2sync will always fill in these fields.


#Optional Fields. 

#  '1' means include these values. 
#  '0' means print a blank value in that field
