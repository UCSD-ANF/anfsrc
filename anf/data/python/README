This directory contains rules to install a number of Python modules to $ANF/lib/python.

Requirements:
 * Python's setuptools module
 * A working localmake_config setup
 * The python bindings for Antelope must be installed. This will create a
   needed symlink in $ANTELOPE/local/bin/python
 * GNU make - This is typically gmake on Solaris, make on Linux and Darwin (Mac OSX)

To use this module installer, do the following:
1. Create a directory named after the module
2. Add that directory name to the DIRS variable in the GNUmakefile located in this directory
3. Create a GNUmakefile in the new module subdirectory. It should look like this:
---SNIP---
# Install Python module MyPythonModule
MODULE_NAME = MyPythonModule
MODULE_VERSION = x.y.x # Where x.y.z is the requested version of the module
include ../pymodule.mk
---SNIP---
