anfsrc - Source for the /opt/anf tree

This repository is designed to be used in conjuction with BRTT Antelope http://brtt.com
It creates a tree under /opt/anf with a version number that matches the current Antelope version.
For example, using Antelope 5.1-64, a directory /opt/anf/5.1-64 will be created

It was originally created with the build_sourcetree application in antelope_contrib.

Code in this repostory should be built similar to that in antelope_contrib. Once installed, see the man page for anfmakefile(5) for details on how to write code to extend this repository.

Usage Instructions:
After the code has been built (see below), you can include the environment in your shell. It will automatically include the Antelope environment.

Replace VERSION with the version of Antelope that you want to use, such as 4.11 or 5.1-64
For bourne compatible shells like sh, ksh, bash:
. /opt/anf/VERSION/setup.sh # Note the period at the beginning

For csh shells like tcsh and csh:
source /opt/anf/VERSION/setup.csh

Build Instructions:

The Build process requires the $ANF and $ANFMAKE environment variables to be set as well as $ANTELOPE. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem, because you use this repository to generate the script that configures the requisite environment variables. Thus, a bootstrap procedure must be used the first time you build the $ANF tree.

First Time Bootstrap:
* Install Antelope on your system.
* Ensure that you have sourced the Antelope environment into your shell. This will set the environment variable $ANTELOPE when done correctly.
* Change dirs to the repository root
* cd adm/coldstart; make
* Source the newly created /opt/anf/VERSION/setup.{sh,csh} file for your respective shell (see usage section above)
* cd ../../ # Changes dirs back to the repository root
* make Include; make; make install

Subsequent builds:
* Source /opt/anf/VERSION/setup.{sh,cs} file for your respective shell (see usage section above)
* Change dirs to the repository root
* make Include; make; make install
